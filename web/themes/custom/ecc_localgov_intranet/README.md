This theme is intended to serve as a simple theme that applies the Essex brand to localgov drupal. It is based off of localgov_base v`1.0.0` (though I'm not sure if this number is updated with each version) the date it was checked out was Wednesday, 19 January 2022.

This theme was originally created using localgov drupal v`2.3.6`.
